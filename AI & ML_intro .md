# What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans. It enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as problem-solving, reasoning, understanding language, and recognizing patterns.

# Types of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is broadly categorized into different types based on capabilities and functionality. Below are the definitions of **Narrow AI**, **General AI**, **Reactive Machines**, and **Limited Memory AI**.

---

## **1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)**

**Definition**: Narrow AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to perform a single specific task. These systems operate under a predefined set of constraints and cannot perform tasks outside their specialization.

**Examples**:
- Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.
- Image recognition systems.
- Recommendation algorithms on platforms like Netflix or YouTube.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Task-specific: Works on one problem or domain.
- Lacks self-awareness and general problem-solving capabilities.

---

## **2. General AI (Strong AI)**

**Definition**: General AI is a theoretical form of AI that can understand, learn, and perform any intellectual task that a human can do. It can generalize knowledge across domains and apply reasoning to solve unfamiliar problems.

**Examples**:
- Currently, General AI does not exist.
- It is the long-term goal of AI research.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Human-level intelligence.
- Capable of learning and reasoning across a wide range of tasks.
- Self-aware and adaptable.

---

## **3. Reactive Machines**

**Definition**: Reactive Machines are the most basic form of AI that operate solely on the present data. These systems do not store past experiences or use memory to influence future actions.

**Examples**:
- IBM’s Deep Blue chess-playing computer.
- Basic robotics that react to environmental stimuli.

**Key Characteristics**:
- No memory or learning ability.
- Focused on current tasks and situations.
- Cannot improve or adapt based on past experiences.

---

## **4. Limited Memory AI**

**Definition**: Limited Memory AI refers to AI systems that can store and use past data temporarily to make better decisions. These systems improve their performance by learning from historical data but have limited memory capabilities.

**Examples**:
- Self-driving cars that analyze traffic patterns and past movements to make decisions.
- Chatbots that learn from previous interactions to refine responses.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Temporary memory storage for learning and decision-making.
- Requires periodic retraining with updated data.
- More advanced than Reactive Machines but not capable of retaining long-term memory.

    - **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Neural Networks**.
       - #### Linear Regression
         - **What it does**: Predicts a number based on a relationship between variables.
         - **Example**: Predicting house prices. If bigger houses usually cost more, linear regression finds the line that best fits the data points (e.g., size of the house vs. price) and uses it to make predictions.
         - **Key idea**: It draws a straight line to show how one thing depends on another.



       - #### Decision Trees
         - **What it does**: Works like a flowchart to make decisions by splitting data into smaller groups based on conditions.
         - **Example**: Deciding if someone will buy a product. The tree might ask:
         - "Is the person older than 30?" (Yes or No)
         - "Do they have a job?" (Yes or No)
         - Based on the answers, it predicts whether they’ll buy the product.
         - **Key idea**: It breaks down decisions step-by-step, like asking questions to narrow down possibilities.



      - #### Neural Networks

# Machine Learning Jargons

## 1. Labeled Data
- **Definition**: Data where each input is paired with the correct output or label.
- **Example**: 
  - Input: Image of a cat.
  - Label: "Cat".
- **Use Case**: Supervised learning models need labeled data to learn.



## 2. Classification
- Classification is a type of machine learning task where the goal is to group data into predefined categories or classes. The model learns from labeled data (where each input is paired with a category) and then predicts the correct category for new inputs.
- **Definition**: A type of machine learning task where the goal is to assign inputs to predefined categories or classes.
- **Example**:
  - Input: An email.
  - Output: "Spam" or "Not Spam".
- **Use Case**: Email spam filters or handwriting recognition.



## 3. Regression
- **Definition**: Predicting a continuous number based on input data.
- **Example**:
  - Input: House size in square feet.
  - Output: Predicted house price in dollars.
- **Use Case**: Stock price prediction or weather forecasting.


## 4. Associations
- **Definition**: Finding rules or patterns that associate items or events in datasets.
- **Example**:
  - If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter (Market Basket Analysis).
- **Use Case**: Recommender systems in e-commerce (e.g., Amazon’s "frequently bought together").



## 5. Clustering
- **Definition**: Grouping similar data points together without predefined labels.
- **Example**:
  - Input: Customer purchase data.
  - Output: Clusters of customers with similar buying behavior.
- **Use Case**: Customer segmentation in marketing.



## 6. Model
- **Definition**: A mathematical representation of the patterns learned from data during training.
- **Example**:
  - A spam detection model that identifies whether an email is spam or not.
- **Use Case**: Models are used to make predictions or decisions on new data.



## 7. Baseline
- **Definition**: A simple or initial model used as a comparison to measure improvement.
- **Example**:
  - Predicting that everyone will buy a product as the baseline, then comparing it to an advanced prediction model.
- **Use Case**: Helps evaluate whether a new model is actually better.



## 8. Convergence
- **Definition**: The point during training when the model’s performance stops improving significantly.
- **Example**:
  - A model’s accuracy reaches 95%, and further training doesn't increase it.
- **Use Case**: Indicates when training should stop.



## 9. Overfitting
- **Definition**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.
- **Example**:
  - A model that memorizes exact answers instead of generalizing.
- **Use Case**: Overfitting leads to poor generalization; techniques like regularization can help avoid it.
